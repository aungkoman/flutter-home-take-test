# J'Donuts App


## Requirement Analysis

- [ ] 10 screens
- [ ] offline first, fully offline
- [ ] clean architecture
- [ ] feature by feature

## 2026-11-11 Wed

- [ ] otp verify usecase
- [ ] login usecase 
- [ ] register usecase
- [ ] home page listing
- [ ] product detail
- [ ] reward , earn and gift listing 


as think of page flows,
there is not login / register

just enter phone number,
on verification of OTP, we will decide it has already registered or not and then where we go.

so use cases should be

- enter phone number , 
- enter otp , so return new / existing user , based on db
- enter name, dob and register
- home page listing
- reward page listing

we need to think as normal api integration.

what we can get back from posting phone number?

user_id , that's all.

on otp verification, we can send user_id and otp_code
what we can get from otp verification,
full user data (name, dob) or empty , since there is no data about user, 
so ask user to enter 
and then register,
register but with user id is already generated , or use phone as key indicator to update, not insert 

great, let's implement this flow.

so usecase should be

- enter_phone
- otp_verify
- enter_user_date
- home_listing
- reward_listing


context.go replaces the stack
let's push 


let's move to home

what we want to show in Home Page

User Info along with member tier
Banners
Categories (Seasonal Specials, Popular )
Product Types ( Donuts, Bread, Cookies , Cake, Beverages , ) \


where we start?

start with entity


prsesentation ကောင်းဖို့ data seeder ပြည်စုံအောင် လုပ်။


let's talk about reward



for presentation purpose
3 easy phone number like

+959 12345678 
+959 12345679
+959 12345670 

with different 
- member tier
- purchase history
- cart 
- reward
- earn
- gift

purchase history can used as earn, 

like the user purchase 3 coconut donuts, so the user will be earn "100 pints " after another purchase of coconuts donuts
so it's like recommendation system, 
what to eat , for to get earn.
it's fun.
nice idea.


so, 
let's test up and running
and then 

prepare short list questions
decisions

and improve ui / ux 
fill requested feature at doc.
